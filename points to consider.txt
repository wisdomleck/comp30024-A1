- always take a swing move if we can?
- how to make it so that two pieces dont chase the same enemy piece
	- heuristic of total distance of each piece to every other piece?
- shave off repeated nodes
- can either do a search method and prune paths, or use a heuristic method and generate paths to a certain depth and take the path with the highest score
